DESCRIPTION
    Catalyst is based upon Maypole, which you should consider for smaller
    projects.

    The key concept of Catalyst is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

    See Catalyst::Manual for more documentation.

    Catalyst plugins can be loaded by naming them as arguments to the "use
    Catalyst" statement. Omit the "Catalyst::Plugin::" prefix from the
    plugin name, so "Catalyst::Plugin::My::Module" becomes "My::Module".

        use Catalyst 'My::Module';

    Special flags like -Debug and -Engine can also be specifed as arguments
    when Catalyst is loaded:

        use Catalyst qw/-Debug My::Module/;

    The position of plugins and flags in the chain is important, because
    they are loaded in exactly the order that they appear.

    The following flags are supported:

    -Debug
        enables debug output, i.e.:

            use Catalyst '-Debug';

        this is equivalent to:

            use Catalyst;
            sub debug { 1 }

    -Engine
        Force Catalyst to use a specific engine. Omit the
        "Catalyst::Engine::" prefix of the engine name, i.e.:

            use Catalyst '-Engine=CGI';

METHODS
    debug
        Overload to enable debug messages.

    config
        Returns a hashref containing your applications settings.

    $c->engine
        Contains the engine class.

    $c->log
        Contains the logging object. Unless it is already set Catalyst sets
        this up with a "Catalyst::Log" object. To use your own log class:

            $c->log( MyLogger->new );
            $c->log->info("now logging with my own logger!");

        Your log class should implement the methods described in the
        "Catalyst::Log" man page.

LIMITATIONS
    FCGI and mod_perl2 support are considered experimental and may contain
    bugs.

    You may encounter problems accessing the built in test server on public
    ip addresses on the internet, thats because of a bug in HTTP::Daemon.
