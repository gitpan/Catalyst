=head1 DESCRIPTION

Frequently Asked Questions

=head2 How do I regenerate the helper scripts?

Create a new app with the same name and copy scripts/ to app directory

=head2 I have added tables to my DB - how to autogenerate the classes?

Just run the _create.pl script again with the same parameters, it will ignore
the existing classes and create missing ones based on your DB layout.

=head2 What is the difference between $c->forward and $c->response->redirect?

Forward will modify the flow control and neither reset the context object nor
end the request cycle while a redirect will. See L<Catalyst::Manual::Intro>.

=head2 How can I get rid of those timer comments when using TT as my view?

This config line in MyApp::V::TT will disable this for you:

    __PACKAGE__->config->{CONTEXT} = undef;
